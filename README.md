# 🚀 UFO Orb Hunt

**UFO Orb Hunt** is a small arcade-style game built with JavaScript and p5.js.

The player controls a UFO using the arrow keys, navigating the screen to collect glowing blue energy orbs while avoiding falling asteroids.

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

This project was created for a class assignment focused on object-oriented programming concepts, including:

- Constructor functions
- Prototypes
- Inheritance
- Multiple object types (`EnergyOrb` and `Asteroid`)
- Shared base object (`SpaceObject`)
- Arrays of objects
- Basic animation and movement logic

The game demonstrates how shared behavior (falling movement) can be defined in a base object type and extended by more specific object types with unique drawing methods.

## 🛠 Built With

- JavaScript
- p5.js
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

---

## 📌 Purpose

Originally created for a programming course project, this game is now part of my GitHub portfolio to demonstrate understanding of object types, prototypes, and interactive canvas-based animation.
